<h2 align="center">Hi there 👋, I'm Rotiken Gisa</h2>

<br />

- 🔭 I've been working on quite a number of projects, one of which is [vuex-persistor](https://github.com/shadrqen/vuex-persistor). It is a Vuex4 and Vue3-ready plugin that saves and rehydrates the state of your application between page reloads 

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are also available at [rotikengisa.com](https://rotikengisa.com). You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/shadrack-rotiken)
